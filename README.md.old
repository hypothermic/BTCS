### Better Tekkit Classic Server +
ForgeBukkit is not availible anymore, and the default TC server's performance is horrible. That's the reason why Project BTCS+ was created.

BTCS+ is a remake of the Tekkit Classic server which focuses on optimization. It is not to be confused with the [old BTCS](https://github.com/hypothermic/BTCS/tree/old_btcs) (which was discontinued due to huge performance issues)

__Current status:__ BTCS+, including Forge and CraftBukkit, is fully working. However there are many bugs with Forge GUI handling. Please report any issues. If you know how to fix them, send a pull request with your fix.
